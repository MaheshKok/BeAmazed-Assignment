# Automated YouTube Script Generator

This project is an automated YouTube script generator that integrates a fine-tuned LLM API. It is designed to expedite script and YouTube thumbnail/asset generation for our internal team of content creators, and later be offered as a SaaS application.

---

## Overview

- **Internal Use:**  
  Initially, the tool will be used by our internal team of around 10 content creators to quickly generate video scripts and related assets (such as thumbnails).

- **SaaS Expansion:**  
  After approximately 6 months, the product will evolve into a full-featured SaaS offering available to external customers.

---

## Approach

### Phase 1: Internal MVP

- **User Interface:**  
  Build a simple web dashboard where content creators can:
  - Input topics or parameters for script generation.
  - Preview generated scripts and thumbnails.
  - Edit and download generated assets.

- **Backend API:**  
  Develop a FastAPI service that:
  - Accepts user inputs and calls a fine-tuned LLM API to generate video scripts.
  - Integrates with an image generation API (e.g., DALL-E, Stable Diffusion) for creating thumbnails/assets.
  - Provides endpoints for script and image generation.

- **Feedback & Iteration:**  
  Collect user feedback and usage metrics to iterate and improve the solution.

### Phase 2: Feature Expansion & Refinement

- **Customization & Templates:**  
  Offer options for script tone, style, and pre-defined templates for both video scripts and thumbnails.

- **User Management:**  
  Implement basic authentication (e.g., JWT) for internal users.

- **Analytics & Logging:**  
  Integrate monitoring and logging to track usage and performance.

### Phase 3: SaaS Scaling

- **Multi-Tenancy & Authentication:**  
  Upgrade user management to support external customers, including roles, billing integration, and secure authentication.

- **Microservices Architecture:**  
  Refactor the backend into separate services (e.g., script generation, image generation, user management) to improve scalability and maintainability.

- **Scalability & Performance Enhancements:**  
  - Deploy multiple backend instances behind a load balancer.
  - Use distributed caching (e.g., Redis) to cache frequently requested responses.
  - Consider asynchronous/event-driven patterns with message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) for handling high-load tasks.

- **Security & Monitoring:**  
  - Employ an API gateway for routing, authentication, and monitoring.
  - Secure sensitive data with TLS/HTTPS and secrets management (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager).
  - Implement advanced monitoring and logging (e.g., ELK stack, Prometheus, Grafana).

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **Framework:** React (or Vue/Next.js) for building a dynamic single-page application.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS or Material-UI for responsive and rapid UI development.
- **State Management:** Redux or React Context for managing application state.

### Backend
- **Framework:** FastAPI (Python) for asynchronous processing and quick API development.
- **Language:** Python 3.8+
- **LLM Integration:**  
  - Fine-tuned LLM API calls using the latest asynchronous OpenAI Python SDK.
  - Integration with an image generation API (e.g., DALL-E, Stable Diffusion) for asset creation.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (for user data, generated scripts, asset metadata).
- **Caching:** Redis for caching frequent requests and responses.
- **Authentication:** JWT-based authentication, with potential future upgrades to OAuth.

### Infrastructure & DevOps
- **Containerization:** Docker for consistent development and deployment.
- **Orchestration:** Kubernetes (or managed services like AWS EKS, Google GKE, or Azure AKS) for scalable deployments.
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins for automated testing and deployment pipelines.
- **Monitoring & Logging:** Prometheus + Grafana for metrics and ELK stack (or Datadog) for logging.
- **Cloud Provider:** AWS, GCP, or Azure based on team expertise and existing infrastructure.

## Summary

1. **MVP for Internal Use:**  
   Develop a simple yet functional application using FastAPI and React. Focus on rapid development and tight feedback loops from internal content creators.

2. **Refinement & Feature Expansion:**  
   Enhance the tool with customization options, better user management, and integrated analytics to refine functionality based on user feedback.

3. **SaaS Transition:**  
   Re-architect the system into a scalable, multi-tenant SaaS solution by breaking out services into microservices, implementing robust security measures, and adopting advanced DevOps practices.
